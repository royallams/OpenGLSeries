# OpenGLSeries
Here I would be tracing out my learning of Open GL . The main aim of this repo is to record openGL learning in a systematic way with every commit as a new chapter.


Currently the code is tested in linux 
- The lib are build from source code.(repo has only linux binaries as of now).


USING THE CODE:-

IN LINUX:-
1) Install QT (any version) and make sure the compiler kit is set properly .
2) Simply clone this repository .
3) Open the examples (like L3_Uniforms)(.pro file) in Qt Creator.
4) Build and Run.

Prefer to read comments ...
